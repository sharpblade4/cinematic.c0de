# Cinematic Code

This repository contains restored code snippets that appeared in movies or TV shows, most of the time with references to their original source. Those snippets are analyzed in an educational facebook page that is aimed for the general public. In each post, a code taken from the cinema is explained in Hebrew. The snapshots as well as the posts' content are also kept in this repository.
